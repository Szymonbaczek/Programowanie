## HTML

Web technologies:

HTML - here we encode content of a website. Text, images, buttons etc. (Content)

CSS - here we can stylish the content that we put earlier in HTML. (Appearance)

PHP - is responsible for mechanical operation of website.

JavaScript - with that you can add good-looking extensions.

SQL - cooperation with data base, making changes in it. SQL is uses inside PHP.

Frameworks - you can build advanced structure of your website. Helps with organisation.

CMS - WordPress alike sides, that let you create websites without writing a code.

## CSS

CSS gives information about appearance and style for website.
How we build CSS code? Example:

selector
{
    property:value;
    property:value;
    property:value;
}

selector - an element of our website, we want to stylish
property - characteristic trait

EXAMPLE:

H1
{
    color:yellow;
    font-size:36px;
    font-weight:bold;
}

More notes in my folder, because I had to create a css file.

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
Cascading = Hierarchy

Inline > HTML head > CSS file

,,!important" - in CSS file goes through above hierarchy

## GIT

What's that for? What am I doing? Where I'm going?
I resolve two first levels at [LearnBranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=pl "LearnBranching"), but I really don't know how and why :D

I have learned:

git commit - adds another commit (?)
git branch - creates new branch
git checkout - changes position before next commands
