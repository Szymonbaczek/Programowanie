# Day 8 (18.08.22)

## HTML

So much work done today. I'm tired and I don't have energy to write anythink here. Just look at my additional files with the same date.

## CSS

Everything in additional files with the same date as this.

I fixed problem with Java Script by replacing (.nav) with (#nav), because I made div, not a class. I'm proud of myself because of that.

## GIT

git branch -f (main or something) (commit number or HEAD~(number)) 

git checkout HEAD~(number)

git reset HEAD~(number) - reseting changes

git revert (name of commit) - creates reverted copy of actual commit
