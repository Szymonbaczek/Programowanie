						<h1>Anthony de Mello: Looking for acceptance</h1>
						<p>14.03.2017 | 19:34:39 | Mortinez Walles</p>
					
					</header>
										
					<p>I invite you to selected excerpts from Anthony de Mello's lectures in my translation, the main theme of which is our search for acceptance of our surroundings. Anthony de Mello is a Jesuit, psychotherapist, mystic, spiritual director. He gained his greatest fame through his books and conferences in the field of spirituality, in which he combined traditional European mysticism with Far Eastern thought, often also entering the field of psychology. I ask you not to assume that the author's views are necessarily in line with my own - this is simply a thought-provoking and question-provoking text. So without further ado - let's give the floor to the author!</p>
					
					<p>Someone once put it beautifully: "Life is something that happens to us while we are busy making plans. We're busy impressing everyone around us; busy making sure we're certainly well-received by others; busy winning Olympics, laurels, being successful and raising our prestige. Life is passing us by; as if you are hypnotized, in a dream, not even knowing you are asleep. How can you wake up? Through understanding. When you see the illusory nature of your ideas, they themselves will fall away from you, you will change. You need awareness and the will to look deeper down the rabbit hole. Today I'm going to talk about one of the biggest human illusions that most of us have not broken away from. If you managed to break free, oh! How awakened you would become!</p>
					
					<p>Let me explain this with a hypothetical example. Assume the existence of a young child who was given a drug very early, regularly. As the child grows up, the child's entire body demands this artificial stimulant, and life without it brings tremendous suffering. You and I, as children, were given the drug. It can be called variously: approval, recognition, praise, success, being accepted, popular. As soon as you took the drug, society gained control over you. You became a robot. Do you want to see how much of a robotic existence people lead? I just happen to have a robot here; he just showed up. I tell it, "My God, you look nice today!" and the robot momentarily sort of internally grows. I press the button that says "approve" and it is already raised to the heavens. However, when I press the "criticism" button, the robot immediately crashes to the ground. Total control; we are so easily approached. Conduct such a test if you don't believe me.</p>

					<p>When we are deprived of the acceptance of those around us, we are downright terrified. We are afraid to make even the smallest mistake, no one ever wants to be laughed at. I remember a certain 3-year-old girl. She appeared in the dining room in her pajamas, she looked so adorable that we applauded by applauding her. Unfortunately, she thought we were laughing at her and ran off with all speed to her room. Her mother had to bring her back to us, while the child shied away as much as she could, not wanting to return to the table. I thought at the time: "This girl is only 3 years old, and we've already managed to make a little monkey out of her."</p>
					
					<p>Of course, awakened people break free from this addiction. Do you think, for example, Christ was influenced by it? But how to break free? Let's perhaps look at the fruits of this attachment of ours. Well, as a result of being addicted to this drug, you have lost the ability to show love. Why? Because you don't even see the other person anymore. You are so focused on subconsciously making sure the person accepts you that you only see people as a threat or support for your drug. Your reactions and responses, and even your emotions, stem directly from the degree of threat or support of your addiction. Think of a politician - he doesn't see people at all before an election, only votes for or against. If, on the other hand, you are neither supportive nor a threat to the outcome of the election, he won't even notice you. Businessmen often don't see people, but money and opportunities to raise money. And we are no better off at all if we still have before our eyes the fact of accepting us or not.</p>

					<p>How can you love what you can't even see? First you have to pull out the tentacles of this addiction, and they have penetrated all the way to the marrow of your bones. You need to watch your reactions and see what the addiction of seeking acceptance changes in you, how it affects you. If you maintain awareness and the will to look deeper, you will soon change. You will be in the world, but no longer of this world. Being with people will no longer involve the existence of a constant tension entitled. "am I accepted here, how can I gain approval". Do you want to love people? You have to die to your need to be admired by them, see exactly what addiction does to you and patiently call a spade a spade. Being alone is not the same as loneliness - to be lonely is necessarily to need people, to be alone is to enjoy the presence of people, but not to need them.</p>
					
					<p>And now a perfect metaphor for life. A group of tourists is in a bus, which is traveling through beautiful, breathtaking landscapes. Interestingly, the curtains inside the vehicle are lowered and completely obstruct the view. The group of tourists inside are arguing among themselves about who among them should take a special place of honor, who is the most popular, the funniest, the prettiest, the strongest.... And so time passes for them until the end of the trip.</p>
